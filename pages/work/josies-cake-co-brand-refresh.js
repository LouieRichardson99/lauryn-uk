          Josie's Cake Co is a bakery based in Northampton that started up just
          over a year ago, and the client was now looking for a brand re-fresh.
          The Client wanted us to use similar colourâ€™s to what they originally
          had, however myself and grace decided to do a copy for the colours
          that we would of used if we had full rein.
